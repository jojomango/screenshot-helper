# Project Phases: Video Player Test Screen Inserter

This document outlines the planned phases for the development of the Chrome extension. Each phase builds on the previous, allowing for incremental progress and clear milestones.

## Phase 1: Basic Functionality
- When the domain matches (`kktv.me` or `netflix.com`), display the `<div class="test-screen"></div>` before the main video player.
- Enable screenshot functionality on the screen when the domain matches.
- No advanced detection or user configuration.
- Focus on verifying injection, visibility, and screenshot capability only.

## Phase 2: TODO
